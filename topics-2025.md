## 25 February meeting

- At our first meeting of the year, attendees were a mix of designers and accessibility testers.
- The discussion centred on the advocacy side of our work, listening to the issues people experience with being the only accessibility expert in the room, and exploring strategies for getting management and decision makers on board.
- One organisation shared the success they had had in turning the culture of their team around, undertaking training to include accessibility best practices in their design and communications work, which resulted in the team receiving recognition from senior management for an important project.
