# Tamsin Ewing

In 2019, Tamsin set up the Digital Accessibility Discussion Group, bringing together accessibility champions in Wellington. The group has been meeting once a month, around a table with a little wine and food, ever since.

Prior to joining W3C, Tamsin worked as a content designer and digital accessibility specialist in the New Zealand public sector.
