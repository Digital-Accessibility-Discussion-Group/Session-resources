# Tamsin Ewing

In 2019, Tamsin set up the Digital Accessibility Discussion Group in Wellington to bring accessibility champions together to share issues and support each others' learning. The group has been meeting once a month ever since.

Tamsin works at World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) team.

Prior to joining W3C, Tamsin worked as a content designer and digital accessibility specialist in the New Zealand public sector.
