# Tamsin Ewing

In 2019, Tamsin set up the Digital Accessibility Discussion Group, bringing together accessibility champions in Wellington. The group has been meeting once a month, around a table with a little wine and food, ever since.

Group members are made up of writers, designers, developers and product owners, with a mix of more experienced accessibility practitioners, and people new to accessibility best practices. The group supports each others' learning and challenges with advocating for accessible digital information and services. 

Tamsin works at World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) team.

Prior to joining W3C, Tamsin worked as a content designer and digital accessibility specialist in the New Zealand public sector.
