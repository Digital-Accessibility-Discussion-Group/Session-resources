# About the group

- [2025-07](2025-07.md#july-2025-session) -    - Steve: I wonder if it might be good to move this content to the Wiki?

See the [page I created](https://github.com/Digital-Accessibility-Discussion-Group/Session-resources/wiki). 

Not sure how best to organise yet. Perhaps we could create a page of resources per year?

[Register to attend](https://wellingtonuni-professional.nz/course/digital-accessibility-discussion-group/)

Group members are made up of writers, designers, developers and product owners, with a mix of more experienced accessibility practitioners, and people new to accessibility best practices.

## Why we meet

Accessibility work can be tiring, especially if you’re the only one pushing for it! In this group, we support each other, share approaches, and learn from each other. We also share how we’re making our work more accessible, and how we’re upping our own skills at accessibility. We meet in person so that we can be open and honest, in a safe space.

Examples of topics and questions from previous meetings:

- How do I make PDFs and Microsoft Office documents more accessible?
- How do I build accessibility into my team’s daily practices?
- How do I convince stakeholders about the value of accessibility work?
- How does inaccessible content exclude people?
