# Steve Barnett

Steve Barnett is a **human-centred front-end developer and user experience designer**. He helps software teams **have happier customers** by making **more user-friendly software**.

He's been building things for the web professionally since 2005 (and built things for fun for a while before that). In Cape Town in South Africa he worked as a front-end developer and UX person (as an employee and as a consultant) at dev shops, design studios, and more. In January 2020 he moved to Wellington in New Zealand and in April 2024 he started at [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/) as a Digital Accessibility Consultant.

He enjoys sharing what he's learned from all the mistakes he's made: **helping people learn new things**, or **get better at things they already known**. He writes about it, speaks and facilitate workshops at meetups, conferences, and at clients. He does **a few talks and workshops a year**, often with a friend who he can learn something from.
