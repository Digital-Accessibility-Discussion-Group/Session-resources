On Tuesday 30th September, the Wellington Digital Accessibility Discussion group will be talking about persuasion and behaviour change. Accessibility work is about people: talking to and with people. Sometimes it’s about motivating people to change their behaviour. That can be difficult! We’ll discuss some ideas and approaches.

As usual, we'll also have time for other topics!

Bring along:

 - your own thoughts and questions for discussion
 - anything you're working on that you'd like to share with the group to explore ways to make it more accessible.

**When:** 4.30pm to 6.30pm, Tuesday 30 September<br>
**Where:** Rutherford House, 33 Bunny Street, Victoria University of Wellington (in-person only)

**About the group, and how to register:** https://wellingtonuni-professional.nz/course/digital-accessibility-discussion-group/

Topics we discussed last month (28 August meeting):

- errors, including messages, colour and managing focus
- how to test error states
