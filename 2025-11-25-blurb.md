Kia ora koutou Wellington Digital A11y Champions

On Tuesday 25th November, we'll be discussing one of the fundamentals of good digital accessibility: headings! Using headings well makes our work easier to understand and navigate. We'll discuss a whole host of ways that not using headings correctly can hinder high quality accessibility. Such as: text that should not be a heading; text should be a heading; and headings that do not reflect the content structure.

And, as usual, we'll also have time for other topics.

Bring along:

- your own thoughts and questions for discussion
- anything you're working on that you'd like to share with the group to explore ways to make it more accessible.

**When:** 4.30pm to 6.30pm, Tuesday 25th November

**Where:** Rutherford House, 33 Bunny Street, Victoria University of Wellington (in person only)

**About the group, how to register and what to bring:**

**Topics we discussed last month** (28 October meeting):

- Tactics in our accessibility work that help us manage burnout in the field of digital accessibility
- Frustrations and strategies when teams hire external contractors who have no accessibility knowledge to build a shiny, new public website, and who do not consult with the organisation's internal accessibility practitioners or test the site with disabled people
