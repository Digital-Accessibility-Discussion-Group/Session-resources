Kia ora koutou Wellington Digital Accessibility Champions

Happy New Year!

Next week will be our first get-together in 2026 — we'll be kicking off with a short retrospective on what people found useful last year and collecting ideas for topics to cover in the next few months. 

As usual, please bring along:

- your own thoughts and questions about digital accessibility for discussion
- anything you're working on that you'd like to share with the group to explore ways to make it more accessible.

**When:** 4.30pm to 6.30pm, Tuesday 24th February

**Where:** Rutherford House, 33 Bunny Street, Victoria University of Wellington (in person only)

**About the group, how to register and what to bring:**
